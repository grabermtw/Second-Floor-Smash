# Contributing

The [full source code](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem) for the Input System is available on GitHub. This is also where most of our development happens.

>__Note__: This includes the full source code for the managed/C# part of the system. At this point, the native, platform-specific C++ backends are still closed-source and require a source code license.

## Reporting Bugs

Please follow Unity's standard [bug reporting guidelines](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/bug-reporting) to report any bugs related to the Input System. Don't forget to submit a Project we can use to reproduce the issue.
