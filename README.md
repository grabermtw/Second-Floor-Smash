# _Second Floor Smash_
A _Super Smash Brothers_ clone using custom assets enabling a wider variety of characters and stages. It is a work-in-progress.

Note that this currently requires a USB or Bluetooth gamepad to play. When you run the game, after the opening animation, you will be taken to the Second Floor of Prince Frederick Hall at University of Maryland. Go to the windows in the room across the hallway from the elevator area. That is where you will find the character select screen for _Smash_.

If you do not have a gamepad but would still like to explore Prince Frederick Hall, there is keyboard support for that part of the game. Use the space bar in place of the "Start" button to continue out of the opening animation, and then use WASD to move and the arrow keys to look around when you reach Prince Frederick Hall. The space bar can be used to open doors. The keyboard support is janky and not recommended unless you have no other options.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to this project (which is encouraged and apppreciated), fork the repository, add your contribution, and then make a pull request and I will merge your contribution with the main project if all looks good.

#### Documentation is available for the following types of contributions:

1. [Adding additional stages](Documentation/AddingStages.md)
2. [Adding additional characters](Documentation/AddingCharacters.md)

Feel free to add more details to the Hub scene as well (the recreation of Prince Frederick Hall), or sound effects, or special moves or more unique character animations. Feel free to reach out if you've got any questions on how to go about that.

You could also use the above documentation to completely change the theme of the game to something other than the former residents of Prince Frederick Hall at University of Maryland. Probably wouldn't want to merge that back in with this project though, unless you create a way to switch themes in-game, which would be very nifty.
