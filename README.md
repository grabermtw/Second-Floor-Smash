# _Second Floor Smash_
A _Super Smash Brothers_ clone using custom assets enabling a wider variety of characters and stages. It is a work-in-progress.

## Adding your own character to _Second Floor Smash_
#### One of the main goals of this project is to make it as easy as possible for anyone to add their own custom characters to the game. This will be a guide for the process I use to do so. This guide assumes that you have a basic understanding of the Unity game engine, and that you have already cloned the repository.
